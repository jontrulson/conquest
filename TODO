- PROTOCOL

  - Sgn16 (x100) 'rating' in _sp_user is wrong.  either needs to be
    expanded (Sgn32) or re-scaled (x10).  ratings over 327.0 will be
    wrong otherwise...

  - send dwarp in shiploc packet so sounds can work better.

  - new server flag? NoKillTeam - determines whether a ship can
    set war with it's own team, or maybe more of a 'Friendly Fire' flag?

  - add pads to those structures not having them?  

  - better UDP negotiation.  Option to enable/disable from within the
    game. 

  - for packets with strings, standardize string len (align 32b) -
    same for meta proto?  increase MOTD, etc...?

  - protocol versioning improvment... use major == incompat, minor ==
    compat...

  - revamp so there is eough info provided to the client to create the
    common block(s) from scratch, rather than relying on compiled-in
    definitions, sizes, names, etc.  

  - send planet size with planet packets (needs to be added to CB)

  - doomsday, add attacking flag (so we know when to draw the APB
    conclusively rather that trying to 'detect' it in the client)
  
   - rework ping/keepalive handling so that they are handled at the
     renderNode level.  Ideally, most (if not all) packet handling
     should be handled here so that node's don't need to owrry about
     it in their Idle routines.

  - ships

    - look into 'dead reckoning' for client display of ship motion.

    - look at some way of allowing triangulation of cloaked ships,
      like in the pre client/se3rver days.  The trick is to be able to
      do this without out making it possible to cheat by modifying the
      client.

    - add a Z component for the future?

  - support downloading of textures from server?

  - meta

    - detect/highlight closed/private servers.  make 'dimmer' sorted
      last? 

  - provide a mechanism to support older protocol(s?), mainly to allow
    playback/conversion of older recordings (which may be using an
    older protocol).

- COMMON BLOCK

  - add field to store IP address of client in ships array.
    For future limiting of concurrent connections from a single IP.

  - add 'size' (in CU's) to planets.

  - resignation - preserve history data.

  - add 'conqinit' CQI info (global, shiptypes, etc) to CB.  Will also
    need protocol support.

  - use flags for planets/ships rather than just the int booleans now
    in use (for example, 'core' and 'visible' items.

    add 'homeplanet' flag so that the hardcoded conquest game values
    are not needed for a teams homeplanet.  Also would need something
    like 'capitalplanet' to indicate the 'primary' planet in the home
    system (that new ships are automatically set course for when
    entering the game).

    add a Z component for the future for objects (ships/planets/etc)?

  - generalize doomsday into a 'eater type' so that other eaters can
    be created (space ameobe, nomad, etc)?

  - come up with some way to export/import CB data into a text file
    for backup, exchange to other machines/architectures, and to
    facilitate upgrading of an existing CB to a new one without
    losing much (any?) data.

  - switch to using 16byte alignment on intel systems, like we use on
    all other non-intel platforms (CB_ALIGN()).

  - think about seperate CB's for ships, planets, and users with '.cb'
    extension. 

    - Would require protocol changes.  Want to keep cqr's compatible
      as well.

      conversion to a new cmnblk format should be possible without
      losing existing data.

    - would allow more dynamic creation of games (for example adding a
      new team, increasing the number of ships, planets, etc).

    - allow definiton of new ship types/capabilities/limits?  


- GENERAL

  - local ship movement computation?  Big/trickey job. would require
    protocol change.

    - how to handle/sync orbiting, tow, etc...

  - observer support?  Can see viewer view only (no hud).

  - provide 'game config' dir containing config files that specify
    things like number of ships allowed, planet definitions (for custom
    universes, etc) for a particular game.

  - provide seperate 'game data dir' like above containing common blocks,
    log locations, etc so a single binary installation could handle
    multiple games (rather than compiling a conquest for each game
    with a different --prefix= ).

    - perhaps game data location, etc defined in conquestrc file that
      can be specified on the conquest/conqoper/conquestd cmd line?

  - enable/disable client recording from within the game

  - allow user to go to the meta list from within the game (without
    restarting with the -m flag).

    - maybe if conquest was run with '-m', then when the users quits
      from the main menu, you go back to the meta list?  

  - might be getting time to get rid of the curses client and rename
    conquestgl to conquest?

  - use syslog, if available, for logging.

- IP restrictions?

  - would need new 'client driver' common block, NUMSHIPS structures
    with IP, PID, interclient-event broadcast flags, etc.

  - IP config file, listing IP's and their limits

  - default server restriction of two ships (conquestrc configurable)
    per IP.

- OpenGL

  - asynchronous server connection handling, so client isn't 'stuck'
    while establishing a connection to a server.

  - SDL OpenGL backend?  remove glut?

  - bigger messages area.

  - indicate team war stat below icon?  Use 'team' icons?

  - add option to disable the 'pulse' messages. Or just rewrk them in
    some way.

- Blue Sky

  - different game types:

    - classic (like it is now)

    - deathmatch - free for all, or team.  

    - Capture The Planet :)

  - wormholes, moving, stationary, uni or bidirectional?  

  - 'Fast' flag... speeding up the game?  Faster regen/cooldown, bombing,
    beaming, speed, firing, etc?
